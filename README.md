# J.A.R.V.I.S.
Minor Project 2018

# J.A.R.V.I.S. is a system to be designed with the objective to digitise the vehicle sticker issuing system and to gather information about vehicles parked in the parking and-or elsewhere in the campus.
# Objectives:
To digitize the system to issue parking stickers to students, faculty, staff and others in the campus.
To make it easier to gather information about vehicles in the campus, thus enabling  the administration to identify defaulters and take relevant action against them.
(Proposed)  To identify if every car that enters the parking is registered or not. The model developed can be used in future if the parkings are automated using boom barriers.
Motivations
1. The current sticker issuing system is entirely paper-based and lacks checks.
i.This causes loopholes like multiple stickers to a single person.
ii.Also, it causes wastage of paper and manpower.

2. There is no system in place to identify defaulters.
i.Currently, it involves chaining up the vehicle and waiting for the owner to turn up
ii.This is clearly inefficient and causes wastage of manpower.

3. As the parking will be automated, real-time identification and entry control can prevent    entry of unauthorized vehicles.
